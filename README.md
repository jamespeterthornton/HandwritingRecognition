handwriting_recognition
=======================

An artificial neural network for classifying handwritten digits.

A C++ implementation of the algorithm presented in Michael Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning."

This is the first neural net that I intend to build in the process of teaching ANNs and deep learning. As I do so, I build this, I will focus less on optimization and more on my own understanding, seeking to implement mathematical functions myself even if there may be a library that I can import which is better optimized than I can make it, or better takes advantage of the GPU, etc. 

Thanks for checking this out. If you have experience with neural nets and have any advice please let me know!
